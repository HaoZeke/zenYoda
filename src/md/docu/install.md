# Getting Started
**zenYoda** is an automated template system focusing on UX and with the intention of enabling pandoc productivity without being concerned about platforms.

This document describes the installation proceedure for various common operating systems and should be verbose enough to compile a **zenYoda** system.

For details on the design of the system refer to the [developer's manual](develop.md) or for user-level customization refer to the [user manual](userman.md).
